# -- Megaflip --
___
### - This is just a quick and interesting program that I thought of when I wanted to determine the fairness of coinflips.

### - The program allows you to make an infinite number of coinflips per "flip", and specify a "best of" parameter.

### - It then reports the winnings to the console, and you can feel confident that the coinflip was fair because it flipped x amount of times.
